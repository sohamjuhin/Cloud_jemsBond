# Cloud_jemsBond
 cloud security assessment

 
## This code will first get information about the cloud account, such as the account ID, name, and region. It will then get a list of all cloud resources for the account, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases. Finally, it will get a list of all cloud security groups for the account.

#  The code can then be used to perform a security assessment of the cloud account. For example, the code could check to see if the cloud resources are properly configured, if the security groups are properly configured, and if there are any known security vulnerabilities.

# To run the code, you will need to install the requests and json Python libraries. You can then run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running the file from the command line. For example, if the file is named Cloud_jemsBond.py, you would run it by typing the following command into the command line:



python  Cloud_jemsBond.py
